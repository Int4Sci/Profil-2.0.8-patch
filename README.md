Profil-2.0.8-patch
==================

Modifed version of the interval library Profil/BIAS.

To use this you need the official Profil/BIAS package from http://www.ti3.tu-harburg.de/Software/PROFILEnglisch.html

This version removes all the ASM code for the rounding operations and -fPIC has been addded to CFLAGS. 

To install the library on Windows, you need the MinGW GNU component & the MSYS shell available at http://www.mingw.org/         
/!\ this version is incompatible with the libraries included in Cygwin
